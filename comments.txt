Limited indiv attention: the distribution of the intrinsic quality

It's anti-instinct to reshare the same message, even the topics you are really really interested in.
I think the possible reason is the limited memory assumption. Even the amount of message is huge,
how can you easily forget the stories or topics which you were greatly impressed such that you have 
to share it to your friends?

Minimum dominating set
permanent dominating set - controllability
minimum number of nodes to control the network.
=> NPC, greedy approximation
=> ILP problem
=> approximation method like

ILP is NPC problem, and various methods have been proposed to solve it. The commercial software
has employed different strategies. As the number of nodes increases, and the structure becomes
more complex, it becomes harder to solve. The relaxing and bounding methods may be helpful.
These methods relax the integer constraints and round the values to integers.

Team Network -> node (team) -> player network
=> player network weight: effectiveness difference (defensive+offensive)
=> overall defensive/offensive

To compute the effectiveness, even the same pair of teams may play in different seasons.
Their defensive and offensive may be evolved as time goes. How about using all past history
of their matches and applying the approach of defining the weighted majority graph in voting
theory.
